fStop,float,"A real lens normally contains a diaphragm or other stop which blocks some of the light that would otherwise pass through it. This stop is usually approximately round, and its diameter as seen from the front of the lens is called the lens diameter. The lens diameter is often described by its relation to the focal length of the lens. A lens whose diameter is one-eighth its local length is said to have an F-stop of 8. This is an optical property of the lens.",create:query:edit,,,,
farClipPlane,linear,Specify the distance to the far clipping plane.,create:query:edit,,,,
farFocusDistance,linear,Linear distance to the far focus plane.,create:query:edit,,,,
filmFit,string:Enum,"This describes how the digital image (in pixels) relates to the film back. Since the film back is defined in terms of real numbers with some arbitrary film aspect, and the digital image is defined in integer pixels with an equally arbitrary (and different) resolution, relating the two can get complicated. There are 4 choices:",create:query:edit,"horizontal:::In this case the digital image is made to fit the film back exactly in the horizontal direction. This then gives each pixel a horizontal size = (film back width) / (horizontal resolution). The pixel height is then = (pixel width) / (pixel aspect ratio). Now that the pixel has a size, resolution gives us a complete image. That image will match the film back exactly in width. It will almost never match in height, either being too tall or too short. By playing with the numbers you can get it pretty close though.","vertical:::This is the same idea as horizontal fit, only applied vertically. Thus the digital image will match the film back exactly in height, but miss in width.",fill:::This is a convenience item. The system calculates both horizontal and vertical fits and then applies the one that makes the digital image larger than the film back.,overscan:::Overscanning the film gate in the camera view allows us to choreograph action outside of the frustum from within the camera view without having to resort to a dolly or zoom. This feature is also essential for animating image planes.
filmFitOffset,float,"Since we know from the above that the digital image may not match the film back exactly, we now have the question of how to position one relative to the other. Thus fit offset. Normally the centers are aligned. Fit offset lets you move the smaller image within the larger one. Specify the distance for film offset (inches).",create:query:edit,,,,
filmRollOrder,string:Enum,Specifies how the roll is applied with respect to the pivot value.,create:query:edit,Rotate-Translate:::The film back is first rotated then translated by the pivot point value.,Translate-Rotate:::The film back is first translated then rotated by the film roll value.,,

filmTranslateV,float,The vertical film translation. Values are normalized to the viewing area.,create:query:edit,,,,

homeCommand,string,"Specify the command to execute when ""viewSet -home"" is applied to this camera. All occurances of ""%camera"" will be replaced with the cameras name before viewSet runs the command.",create:query:edit,,,,
horizontalFieldOfView,angle,"This is the film back width as seen by the lens when focused at infinity (ie., focal length away) measured as an angle. Note that it has nothing to do with pixels or the digital image or any aspects. Angle of view is a derived field, that is, it is not used internally by Alias and can be completely determined from other information. It is included as a convenience for the user. Its derivation is aov = 2 * atan( fbw / (2 * f) ) where ""aov"" is the angle of view, ""fbw"" is the film back width and ""f"" is the focal length.",create:query:edit,,,,
horizontalFilmAperture,float,The horizontal width of the camera's film plane. The camera's film is located on the film plane. The extent of the film which will be exposed to an image of the scene in front of the lens is limited to a rectangular area described by the film back. This double precision parameter is always specified in inches.,create:query:edit,,,,
horizontalFilmOffset,float,"Horizontal offset from the center of the film back. Normally the film back will be centered on the lens axis. However, this need not be so. Film offset is the displacement of the center of the film back from the lens axis, also measured in inches. Note that offsetting the film back will distort the image, but will not alter the focus. This double precision parameter is always specified in inches.",create:query:edit,,,,
horizontalPan,float,Horizontal 2D camera pan (inches),create:query:edit,,,,
horizontalRollPivot,float,The horizontal pivot point from the center of the film back. The pivot point is used during rotation of the film back. The pivot is the point where the rotation occurs around. This double precision parameter corresponds to the normalized viewport. This value is a part of the post projection matrix.,create:query:edit,,,,
horizontalShake,float,"Another horizontal offset from the center of the film back, which can be used and stored on the camera in addition to the horizonal film offset attribute. This allows for film-based camera shake internal to the camera. This works in exactly the same units and coordinates that the film offset attribute does. The effect of this attribute is toggled by the shake enabled attribute.",create:query:edit,,,,
journalCommand,boolean,Journal interactive camera commands. Commands can be undone when a camera is journaled.,create:query:edit,,,,
lensSqueezeRatio,float,"This is presently just an information field in the camera editor is meant to convey the horizontal distortion of the anamorphic lens normally used with some film formats. If it were used, it would do something like pixel aspect. Remember however that lens distortion (intentional or not) is slightly different than the output hardware's quantization. The fact that a ""net"" distortion parameter could be used for both may or may not confuse the issue.",create:query:edit,,,,
lockTransform,boolean,"Lock the camera. When a camera is locked, its transformation information, that is, its Translate and Rotate properties cannot be adjusted, and the center of interest point cannot be moved. For orthographic cameras, Orthographic Width is also locked. For camera groups, Aim and Up locator's translate is also locked. For stereo cameras, the root camera is locked.",create:query:edit,,,,
