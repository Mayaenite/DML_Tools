name,Argument types,doc,Properties,Argument Enum 1,Argument Enum 2,Argument Enum 3,Argument Enum 4
absolute,boolean,The joint center position is in absolute world coordinates. (This is the default.),create:query:edit,,,,
angleX,angle,"Set the x-axis angle. When queried, this flag returns a float.",create:query:edit,,,,
angleY,angle,"Set the y-axis angle. When queried, this flag returns a float.",create:query:edit,,,,
angleZ,angle,"Set the z-axis angle. When queried, this flag returns a float.",create:query:edit,,,,
assumePreferredAngles,boolean,Meaningful only in the edit mode. It sets the joint angles to the corresponding preferred angles.,edit,,,,
automaticLimits,boolean,"Meaningful only in edit mode. It sets the joint to appropriate hinge joint with joint limits. It modifies the joint only if (a) it connects exactly to two joints (one parent, one child), (b) it does not lie on the line drawn between the two connected joints, and the plane it forms with the two connected joints is perpendicular to one of its rotation axes.",create,,,,
children,boolean,"It tells the command to apply all the edit options not only to the selected joints, but also to their descendent joints in the DAG.",edit,,,,
component,boolean,Use with the -position switch to position the joint relative to its parent (like -relative) but to compute new positions for all children joints so their world coordinate positions do not change.,create:edit,,,,
degreeOfFreedom,string,"Specifies the degrees of freedom for the IK. Valid strings consist of non-duplicate letters from x, y, and z. The letters in the string indicate what rotations are to be used by IK. The order a letter appear in the string does not matter. Examples are x, yz, xyz. When queried, this flag returns a string. Modifying dof will change the locking state of the corresponding rotation attributes. The rule is: if an rotation is turned into a dof, it will be unlocked if it is currently locked. When it is turned into a non-dof, it will be locked if it is not currently locked.",create:query:edit,,,,
exists,string,"Does the named joint exist? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.",query,,,,
limitSwitchX,boolean,"Use the limit the x-axis rotation? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.",create:query:edit,,,,
limitSwitchY,boolean,"Use the limit the y-axis rotation? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.",create:query:edit,,,,
limitSwitchZ,boolean,"Use the Limit the z-axis rotation? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.",create:query:edit,,,,
limitX,"[angle, angle]","Set lower and upper limits on the x-axis of rotation. Also turns on the joint limit. When queried, this flag returns 2 floats.",create:query:edit,,,,
limitY,"[angle, angle]","Set lower and upper limits on the y-axis of rotation. Also turns on the joint limit. When queried, this flag returns 2 floats.",create:query:edit,,,,
limitZ,"[angle, angle]","Set lower and upper limits on the z-axis of rotation. Also turns on the joint limit. When queried, this flag returns 2 floats.",create:query:edit,,,,
name,string,"Specifies the name of the joint. When queried, this flag returns a string.",create:query:edit,,,,
orientJoint,string,"The argument can be one of the following strings: xyz, yzx, zxy, zyx, yxz, xzy, none.",edit,,,,
orientation,"[angle, angle, angle]","The joint orientation. When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.",create:query:edit,,,,
position,"[linear, linear, linear]","Specifies the position of the center of the joint. This position may be relative to the joint's parent or in absolute world coordinates (see -r and -a below). When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.",create:query:edit,,,,
radius,float,Specifies the joint radius.,create:query:edit,,,,
relative,boolean,The joint center position is relative to the joint's parent.,create:query:edit,,,,
rotationOrder,string,"The rotation order of the joint. The argument can be one of the following strings: xyz, yzx, zxy, zyx, yxz, xzy.",create:query:edit,,,,
scale,"[float, float, float]","Scale of the joint. When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.",create:query:edit,,,,
scaleCompensate,boolean,"It sets the scaleCompenstate attribute of the joint to the given argument. When this is true, the scale of the parent joint will be compensated before any rotation of this joint is applied, so that the bone to the joint is scaled but not the bones to its child joints. When queried, this flag returns an boolean.",create:query:edit,,,,
scaleOrientation,"[angle, angle, angle]","Set the orientation of the coordinate axes for scaling. When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.",create:query:edit,,,,
secondaryAxisOrient,string,"The argument can be one of the following strings: xup, xdown, yup, ydown, zup, zdown, none.",edit,,,,
setPreferredAngles,boolean,Meaningful only in the edit mode. It sets the preferred angles to the current joint angles.,edit,,,,
stiffnessX,float,"Set the stiffness (from 0 to 100.0) for x-axis. When queried, this flag returns a float.",create:query:edit,,,,
stiffnessY,float,"Set the stiffness (from 0 to 100.0) for y-axis. When queried, this flag returns a float.",create:query:edit,,,,
stiffnessZ,float,"Set the stiffness (from 0 to 100.0) for z-axis. When queried, this flag returns a float.",create:query:edit,,,,
symmetry,boolean,Create a symmetric joint from the current joint.,create:edit,,,,
symmetryAxis,string,"This flag specifies the axis used to mirror symmetric joints. Any combination of x, y, z can be used. This option is only used when the symmetry flag is set to True.",create:edit,,,,
zeroScaleOrient,boolean,It sets the scale orientation to zero and compensate the change by modifing the translation and joint orientation for joint or rotation for general transform of all its child transformations.,edit,,,,
